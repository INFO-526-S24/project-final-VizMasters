## Abstract

In the world of cancer research, there's a lot of information to sift through. Researchers are left to sort through the abundance of new cancer-related data collected daily. However, interpreting all this data to produce actionable insights that improve our understanding of and ability to combat cancer presents a significant challenge. Welcome to "Analyze: Cancers - leading Cause of Death Globally" presented by VizMasters. Join us as we employ visualization techniques to delve into the intricate patterns of cancer-related deaths and their wide-ranging effects on mortality rates across the globe.

Cancer continues to be a significant challenge for global health, impacting mortality rates and quality of life across the world. In 2022 alone, an estimated 9.7 million cancer-related deaths occurred, accompanied by 20 million new cases worldwide. Despite remarkable strides in understanding and managing cancer, the relentless rise in global mortality rates persists unabated. Our project endeavors to tap into the extensive datasets available on cancer fromÂ <https://ourworldindata.org/cancer>, curated by Max Roser and Hannah Ritchie. By integrating diverse datasets, we seek to unravel the intricate patterns underlying cancer distribution and its multifaceted impacts on diverse populations.

The project draws upon an array of CSV files obtained from the provided source, each offering valuable insights into cancer statistics. The datasets encompass a wide range of information, including annual counts of deaths attributed to various causes, specific cancer types, and their distribution across different age demographics. Additionally, the datasets provide data on cancer death rates, prevalence within the population, and trends over time and across regions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the impact of cancer on global mortality.

As we explore the data further, we see that each dataset can help us discover new things and hidden patterns. Every bit of information we find brings us closer to understanding cancer better and how it affects people everywhere. Our understanding of the fight against cancer can be further enhanced by carefully examining this data using visual aids.

As we set sail on this journey, our initial destination is the realm of mortality statistics. Here, we dive deep into the data to demonstrate the extent to which cancer affects the number of deaths worldwide. Utilizing an animated barplot, we dynamically illustrate how cancer affects lives across different countries from the years 1990 to 2019, capturing the evolving impact of this disease throughout history. We've visualized the animated barplot using the combination of ggplot2 and plotly.
